# ToxPathEngine

## Overview

This repository contains the code and associated resources for the research presented in the manuscript titled "**Preclinical Side Effect Prediction through Pathway Engineering of Protein Interaction Network Models**". The research focuses on enhancing drug side effect predictions using protein interaction networks and pathway engineering, by including key pathway genes and omics data measurements. Running **ToxPathEngine** will generate all [PathFX](https://github.com/jenwilson521/PathFX) results along with predictions per side effect, e.g., sensitivity and specificity.
